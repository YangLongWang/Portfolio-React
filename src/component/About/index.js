            Hello! My name is Longyang Wang. I'm a full-stack developer.
            Full-stack web developer with bootcamp certificate from the
            University of Toronto. Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js,
            Node.js, Express.js, Python, and responsive web design. An
            innovative practitioner and problem solver who is passionate about
            developing applications, focusing on mobile-first design and
            development, with a clean and comfortable front-end UI. Strong
            execution skills and team player. Each project can achieve the best
            readability, and the data structure is clear. Good understanding of
            project requirements and outlines. I have strong execution and
            coordination skills in teamwork and can quickly promote the plan's
            development. My goal is to be an excellent web developer. I like to
            face different challenges in the process, and I feel a strong sense
            of accomplishment when I finish the project and solve the problems
            encountered in programming. I'm excited to use my skills and
            characteristics to build better experiences on the web.
